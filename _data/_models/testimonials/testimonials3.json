  "testimonial_text": "<div>\n<div>After pouring over travel sites, maps and apps for a room with a balcony on the sand, I found this little</div>\n<div>gem. First, the staff, from the top down, were friendly, helpful and seemingly happy at work. We were</div>\n<div>happy, as well with, FREE breakfast, NO resort fees, NO parking charges, NO wifi premiums! Our room was</div>\n<div>beautiful, clean and quite large at 700 sq ft with a balcony right on the ocean perfect for viewing the</div>\n<div>sunset! The facility also offered a pool, hot tub and fire pit; beach chairs, towels, beach umbrellas</div>\n<div>and boogie boards. We walked all over town at night enjoying all that Carlsbad offers. Looking forward</div>\n<div>to next year at our new favorite spot in the San Diego area.</div>\n</div>",
