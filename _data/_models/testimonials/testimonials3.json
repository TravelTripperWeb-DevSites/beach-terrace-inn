  "title": "Our little secret",
  "testimonial_text": "After pouring over travel sites, maps and apps for a room with a balcony on the sand, I found this little gem. First, the staff, from the top down, were friendly, helpful and seemingly happy at work. We were happy, as well with, FREE breakfast, NO resort fees, NO parking charges, NO wifi premiums! Our room was beautiful, clean and quite large at 700 sq ft with a balcony right on the ocean perfect for viewing the sunset! The facility also offered a pool, hot tub and fire pit; beach chairs, towels, beach umbrellas and boogie boards. We walked all over town at night enjoying all that Carlsbad offers. Looking forward to next year at our new favorite spot in the San Diego area.",
