It's impossible to get</div>\n<div>any closer to the sand and/or ocean than this wonderful place. I have been there 6 times (the first being</div>\n<div>in 1987!) and will continue to come back . My daughters and I love that you can walk to many places to</div>\n<div>eat, we do not have to bring beach chairs or umbrellas - it's already there for us. We also love how</div>\n<div>children-friendly the Inn is. Recommend this place to family and friends year after year!!!!!</div>\n</div>",
