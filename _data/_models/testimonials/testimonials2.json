  "testimonial_text": "Location is perfect, the entire staff is precious, couldn't have been happier!!!!! It's impossible to get any closer to the sand and/or ocean than this wonderful place. I have been there 6 times (the first being in 1987!) and will continue to come back. My daughters and I love that you can walk to many places to eat, we do not have to bring beach chairs or umbrellas - it's already there for us. We also love how children-friendly the Inn is. Recommend this place to family and friends year after year!!!!!",
