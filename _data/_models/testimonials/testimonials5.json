  "testimonial_text": "<div>\n<div>This is a wonderful hotel in a beautiful location. We had a partial ocean view room, but could see the</div>\n<div>amazing Carlsbad sunsets perfectly. The room was huge, clean and a great place to relax. The staff went</div>\n<div>out of their way to ensure that everything was perfect...and it was! In particular they spent a lot of</div>\n<div>time ensuring that the pool and beach areas were kept spotless and that everyone had beach chairs, towels,</div>\n<div>umbrellas and boogie boards. The location is great for evenings too with dozens of restaurants within</div>\n<div>10 minutes walk. Loved it!!</div>\n</div>",
