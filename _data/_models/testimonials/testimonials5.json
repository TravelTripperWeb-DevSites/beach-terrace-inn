  "testimonial_text": "This is a wonderful hotel in a beautiful location. We had a partial ocean view room, but could see the amazing Carlsbad sunsets perfectly. The room was huge, clean and a great place to relax. The staff went out of their way to ensure that everything was perfect...and it was! In particular they spent a lot of time ensuring that the pool and beach areas were kept spotless and that everyone had beach chairs, towels, umbrellas and boogie boards. The location is great for evenings too with dozens of restaurants within 10 minutes walk. Loved it!!",
