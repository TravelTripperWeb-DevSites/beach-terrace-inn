Built in the 1960s, we were originally apartments - which explains our <a title=\"Rooms at Beach Terrace Inn\" href=\"https://www.beachterraceinn.com/rooms/\">huge rooms</a> - and our stairs. Since then, we&rsquo;ve expanded, growing organically from one building in the 1960s to a second in the 1970s and the third in the 1980s. Yet even today we&rsquo;re still family-owned and operated - and still the only hotel in Carlsbad that&rsquo;s on the beach - our own private beach, that is.</p>",
